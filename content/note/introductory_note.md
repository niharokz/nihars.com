Hello! I am glad that you visited my blog. I assumed that I would never get any traffic on my blog. But you are here, making my assumption incorrect.    

Writing the first post for a blog is often a struggle, isn't it? After spending a lot of time thinking and googling, I concluded that there is no foolproof way to start a blog. But writing a simple and tl;dr introduction can do my work. So, here it is :    

I am a hobbyst developer. I created this space to articulate my hobby. My personal goal to start this blog is to improve my writing skills.   

Finally, I wanted to say thanks to everyone who visited my website and spent the time to read it. Grateful to every single person who viewed it. Any suggestions are always welcomed.
